    <p id="paragraph" > Narrative paragraphs are the building blocks 
        you need to tell a story in English. This type of paragraph explains something 
        that happened. 
        Think about a time that a friend or family member came to you and said,
        “guess what!”. They probably then told you a story about something that
        happened to them. This is what a narrative paragraph is, but in written form.
